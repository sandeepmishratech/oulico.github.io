Hello, <br>
World. <br>
This blog is where I post the things I studied and things in which I'm interested. (like, coding, linguistics, translation, etc.) <br>
The name, OuLiCo stands for "Ouvroir de Linguistique et Coding" which is an homage to "OuLiPo(Ouvroir de Litt√©rature Potentielle)", the french literature group in France. This group's consisted of a lot of mathematicians and scientists. They have done marvelous work with logic and literature. Coding also could be a kind of jolly literature with logical thinking in it, I guess. So I made OuLiCo as my username for this blog, hoping I could learn and enjoy linguistics and coding :) (phew, TMI?)<br> 
Anyway, Nice to meet you. B-Y-E
