# How to learn Coding in no time



- Clear goal
  - set a specific, measurable, realistic and time-based goal
  - Know exactly why you are learning to code
  - Imagine a big project you want to be able to build!
  - Research technologies and then learn them
- Don't copy code without caring how it works
  - understand the code that you're studying and typing
  - Always type the code, don't copy-paste
- Reinforce what you've learned
  - After you learn a new feature or concept, use it immediately
  - take notes
  - Challenge yourself and practice with small coding exercises and challenges
  - Don't be in a hurry to complete the course fast
- Practice coding outside of the courses, come up with own project ideas
  - practicing on your own is the most important thing to do
  - This is not optional! Without practice outside of courses, you won't go anywhere!
  - Come up with your own project ideas or copy popular sites or applications, or just parts of them in the beginning
  - Don't be stuck in "tutorial hell"
- Don't give a fuck about efficiency or cleaness for now.
- Don't lose your motivation because you thought you could never know enough
- Do not learn in isolation
  - learn with other people
  - share your goals to make your self accountable
  - #100DaysOfCode, CodeNewbie, #webdev. etc
- Courses are an amazing starting point, but are only the beginning of your journey!!
