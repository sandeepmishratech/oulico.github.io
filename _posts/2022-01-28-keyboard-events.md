## How to respond to keyboard events

The key press event is just another type of event.

keyboard events are `global events` because they **do not happen on one specific element**.

For `global events` like keyboard events, we usually listen on the whole document.





There are 3 types of events for the keyboard

```js
document.addEventListener(`keyup`)//triggers when the finger off the keyboard

document.addEventListener(`keydown`)//triggers as soon as you press the key

document.addEventListener(`keypress`)//triggers continuously while you're pressing the key.

```



As you hit any key on the keyboard, a `keydown` event is generated.

When an event happened, JavaScript generates an `object`.

And that `object` contains all the information about the event itself, and we can access that `object` in the `event handler function`.



## What happens?

```js
document.addEventListener(`keydown`, function (e) {
  console.log(`A key is pressed`);
});
```



As the event occurs, JavaScript will call this function with the event object **as an argument.**

This works because we **do not call this function**

We only define it here.



Not you know why this function has access to an event, so let's take a look at this `e`.



## Inside of an event

```js
document.addEventListener(`keydown`, function (e) {
  console.log(e);
});
```

So you can see this object that is generated by a JavaScript.

Il looks like the objects that we generated ourselves previously.

you can see `property`s and `value`s

and you can see the `key: "Enter"`



## To use the property and value in the event

```js
document.addEventListener(`keydown`, function (e) {
  console.log(e.key);//here
});
```

we use `dot(.)` and then the `property name` to read any property from an object.

And now that we know which key was actually pressed, you can use that information.



```js
document.addEventListener(`keydown`, function (e) {
  if (e.key === `Enter`)
    console.log(`Enter is pressed`);// use the function you wanted
});
```
