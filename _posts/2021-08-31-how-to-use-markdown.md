## What is Markdown?

> `Markdown` is a [lightweight markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language) for creating [formatted text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formatted_text) using a [plain-text editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor).

## Why Markdown?

- **For web writing**

  You can perfectly convert your text in HTML. It's light weight and that make it easy to storage.

- **For every software**

  Since this is a plain text format, it is usable and openable in any devices, and OS. It has only one filetype (unlike MSWord or any other word processors), so software doesn't need to keep up with the format.

- **Simple but powerful enough**

  Easy to add text modifiers like lists, bold, italics, etc. And you can insert tables too.

- **For productive writing**

  Markdown is easy and simple to learn and use than HTML or any other web programming language. For exemple, with Markdown language, you don't need to close every tags like you do with HTML.

- **For version management**

  Since it is plain text, it's easy to manage versions through `Git` .

# Basic Markdown Syntax

> Type the lines in the codeblocs one by one with your editor to learn. You'll see the simplicity and usefulness of Markdown.

- **[Step1] `Headings`**

  To create a heading, add number signs (`#`) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level.

```markdown
# Heading level 1

## Heading level 2

### Heading level 3

#### Heading level 4

##### Heading level 5

###### Heading level 6
```

**Renderd output:**

# Heading level 1

## Heading level 2

### Heading level 3

#### Heading level 4

##### Heading level 5

###### Heading level 6
