Making a Node.JS project easily w/ npm 



Type this in terminal:

```shell
mkdir /workplace/newproject
code /workplace/newproject
```



⚠︎ If there's no `code` command in terminal, you can easily install via VSC. On VSC, type `cmd`+ `shift`+ `p` and click `Shell command: install code command in PATH`



And type this in terminal again

```she
git init
```





Make a repository on GitHub and copy the URL.

And paste it next to `git remote add origin` :

```she
git remote add origin YOURURL
```

 

type

```shell
npm init
```
