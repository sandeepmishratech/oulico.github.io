What is the DOM and how to manipulate it



## DOM

**Document Object Model:**

> Structured representation of HTML documents. Allows JS to access html elements and styles to manipulate them.

## Dom is not JavaScript

`DOM Methods` and `properties for DOM manipulation` are **not** part of JavaScript.

Then how does this all work?

`DOM` and `DOM methods` are actually part of `web API`s.

(API: Application Programming Interface)

Web APIs are libraries that browsers implement and that we can access from our JavaScript code.

webAPIs are libraries that are also written in JavaScript and that are automatically available for us to use.
