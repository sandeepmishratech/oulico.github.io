# How to think as a developer: Solving problems



### Problems:

- Jumping at the problem without thinking carefully
- Implementing the solutions in an unstructured way
- Getting stressed out when things don't work
- Being too proud to research solutions



### Fix:

- Stay calm and slow down, don't just jump at a problem without a plan
- Take a very logical and rational approach 
- Use **4 steps** below



## 4 Steps to solve any problem:

1. **Understand the problem**. Ask the right question to get a clear picture of the problem
2. **Divide and conquer**: Break a big problem into smaller sub-problems.
3. Don't be afraid to do as much **research** as you have to
4. For bigger problems, **write pseudo-code** before writing the actual code
