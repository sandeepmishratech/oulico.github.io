## What is JavaScript?

> Javascript is a high-level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language.

- High-level language means: it is friendly language to humans. You don't need to think about the complex things like the computer's memories while it runs or program. So in JS, there are a lot of abstractions over all these small details that we don't want to worry about.
- Object oriented means:  the language is based on the concept of objects for storing most kinds of data.
- Multi-paradigm language: meaning that it's so flexible and versatile, that we can use all kinds of different programming styles, such as [`imperative` and `declarative programming`](http://oulico.github.io/basic_knowledge/2021/09/01/programming_paradigm.html). These are different ways of structuring the code.

## Why Learn JS

### 1. JS is the base of lots of libraries

JavaScript is the base of frameworks and libraries such as `Vue`, `Angular`, `React` etc. They are 100% based on JS.

They might someday go away but still JS won't. So that's why learning JS properly is so important to prepare the future.

### 2. JS is usable outside of web browser. 

 You can use JS on web servers.(i.e. `Node.js`) Thus,

+ You can create backend applications
+ You can create Frontend applications



#### And also

You can use JS to create Native mobile applications (`React`, `Ionic`), and desktop applications(`Electron`)
