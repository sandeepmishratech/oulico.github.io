# The difference between "declarative" vs "imperative" in programming



## Wikipedia says...

### Declarative programming

> Declarative programming is **a non-imperative style of programming in which programs describe their desired results without explicitly listing commands** or steps that must be performed. Functional and logical programming languages are characterized by a declarative programming style.

### Imperative programming

> imperative programming is **a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state**.  In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform.

### 

## In short,

Example of declartive/imperative programming for right brain users:

Example 1 : To make a sandwich,



**Declarative programming** 

1. Put a slice of bread
2. Put a slice of ham on the bread 
3. Put a slice of bread



**Imperative programming**

1. make a sandwich
